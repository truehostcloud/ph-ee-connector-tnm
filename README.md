# ph-ee-connector-tnm

This connector incorporates job worker implementations responsible for polling available jobs in Zeebe and communicating with TNM Malawi's endpoint.
It currently facilitates the Paybill flow.


This connector is a Zeebe project that is part of the OAF Payment Hub EE setup. See
the [Payment Hub EE documentation](https://mifos.gitbook.io/docs/payment-hub-ee/overview)
for more information about Zeebe projects and Payment Hub in general.

## Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Apache Camel
- Zeebe Java Client

## Getting Started

Clone the project

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/one-acre-fund/ph-ee-connector-tnm.git
    cd ph-ee-connector-tnm
  ```

This connector is expected to be run alongside other connectors/services. It depends on some of
those services being up and healthy.
For local development, the services that are most critical for running this project
have been included in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The following components are included:

- Zeebe: A workflow engine for microservices orchestration. This must be running in a healthy state
  otherwise errors
  will occur when the services below attempt to connect to it.
- Zeebe-ops: Provides APIs for carrying out certain operations on zeebe such as uploading a bpmn
  file
- Channel-connector: Provides APIs for initiating collection requests
- Fineract-connector: Acts as Account management system(CLIF) - any other ams connector can be used
- Pesa-connector: Acts as an account managment system for Roster

A lot more services can be added to the above based on your needs, but to run the tnm-mw
connector locally,
the ones listed above are the required minimum.
Please note that the `docker-compose.yml` file in this repository should NOT be used in a production
environment.

## Running with Docker

Some images listed in the `docker-compose.yml` are available on OAF's Azure Container Registry (
ACR). To be able to pull
them, certain permissions must be granted to your azure account. Follow the steps below to
successfully run the project:

- Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed on your machine

- Authenticate with
  azure. [Install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
  on your machine if it's not already available, and then run the command below

  ```bash
      az acr login -n oaftech # Log in to OAF's ACR through the Docker CLI.
   ```

- Run the project:

  Update `src/main/resources/application.yml` with the appropriate values where necessary, or
  provide the
  values as environment variables in the `services.fineract-connector.environment` section of
  the `docker-compose.yml`
  file, and run the command below:

  ```bash
      docker compose up -d
   ```

## Usage

To initiate a request, follow the steps below:

- Upload the TNM MW Paybill bpmn (found in `src/main/resources/momo_flow_mtnfineract-oaf.bpmn`) through **zeebe-ops**
  by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:5001/zeebe/upload` with the file attached.

- Send a collection request through the **channel-connector** by sending a POST request
  to `http://localhost:5002/channel/collection` with Platform-TenantId as mw-oaf in the headers,
  with a sample body as shown below:
  ```json
  {
    "payer": [
        {
            "key": "MSISDN",
            "value" :"250788111111"
        },
        {
            "key":"FINERACTACCOUNTID",
            "value":"24450520"
        }
    ],
    "amount": {
        "amount": "1",
        "currency": "EUR"
    },
    "transactionType": {
        "subScenario": "BUYGOODS",
        "initiator": "PAYEE",
        "initiatorType": "BUSINESS"
    }
  }
  ```
    - Check the logs in the **tnm-mw-connector** container to see that a payment has been initiated. For the sandbox,
      a callback will not be sent back. We can simulate it ourselves to continue the workflow by calling the endpoint
      `http://localhost:5004/buygoods/callback` with the following body
      ```json
      {
        "financialTransactionId": "1663251507",
        "externalId": "{TransactionID received from the previous channel connector endpoint}",
        "amount": "1",
        "currency": "EUR",
        "payer": {
            "partyIdType": "MSISDN",
            "partyId": "46733123451"
            },
        "status":"SUCCESSFUL"
      }
      ```

    - Check the logs in the **tnm-mw-connector** connector to see if the confirmation is processed
    - Check the logs in the **fineract-connector** ams connector to see if the settlement is processed in the ams

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs while carrying out any of the steps above, check if the zeebe container is in a
healthy state by
either viewing its state through `docker ps` or sending a GET request
to `http://localhost:9600/health`.
If the zeebe container shows state as unhealthy or the health endpoint doesn't return a 204 status
response, restart the
zeebe container.
